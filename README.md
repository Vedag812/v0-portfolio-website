## Admin Media Editor

- Set an `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable (locally in `.env.local`, and in your hosting dashboard) to secure the media editor.
- Visit `/admin` while the dev server or deployment is running, enter the token, and update the URLs for the profile image and section backgrounds.
- Save changes to persist them to `data/media.json`, then refresh the site to see the new assets.
